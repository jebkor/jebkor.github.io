# blog.jebkor.dk

A warm welcome, traveller. You have stumbled upon this repo, which is my github-pages repo for my blog. You are more than welcome to have a look and see, what's behind the curtains, but there is not much to it.

I try to be active and post, but there is no real schedule.

## I want to learn more about you
You can follow me on social media and see what is going on now and then. I try to share my opinions, news or keep you updated, and you can interact with me, if you want to. The best place to reach me, would be [twitter](https://twitter.com/jebkor_).

Other than my twitter profile, you can ask me questions on my [AMA Repo (ask-me-anything)](https://github.com/jebkor/ama). There is a guide on how you can ask me questions, and will be another, great way for you to reach me.

## Now go be awesome
No, seriously. Go be awesome!

The world is full of stuff to do: Go create *something*, go play that game that you are 65% done with anyway, go for a walk. Anything.

Anyways, those were the final words. Thanks for staying this long.

See you around
