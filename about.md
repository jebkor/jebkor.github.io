## Hi, my name is Jesper. Stay a while, and listen.
<br>

Being able to quickly find answers and to gain inspiration, I wanted to keep a blog about all things frontend and other things I find interesting in the industry.

**Disclaimer: May contain nuts, rants about health and other unrelated things. You have been warned 😈**

<br>


I have been working as a frontend developer for the past three years. I have a background as a "Multimedia Designer" and I always swore to myself, never to get into anything related to coding. Well, would you look at that!.

I am currently working for a company in Denmark called "Insero A/S", who takes the lead in the green transition with sustainable energy solutions. Before that, I worked in a small five-man company who created websites for business and self-serivce solutions for electricity suppliers.


In my spare time I like to work on different side projects, either to improve my workflow, understand a new framework or just make silly things. Oh and I like running and do CrossFit as well. It's pretty dope! 🏋🏼


Most of my projects and and code is available online on my [GitHub](https://github.com/jebkor). Feel free to take a look - and under my profile you'll find links to the different corners of the internet I live in.


I want to be one of the cool kids, so I've created a GitHub AMA [repo](https://github.com/jebkor/ama), where you can open issues to ask me questions. If you don't want to do that, send me a [mail](mailto:jesper@jebkor.dk). If you don't like **that**, send me a DM on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/jebkor_).

Because the internet is a big place, standard disclaimers about these being my views and not my employer's apply.
